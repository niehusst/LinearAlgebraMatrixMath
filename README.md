# Linear Algebra Matrix Math

This is a class that allows for the creation of matricies and contains some
methods pertinant to typical matrix mathematics, including some basic linear
algebra methods.

## Getting Started

To use the code, download the python files into the same directory, and run
the matrixInterface file. Or, just import the Matrix.py file to any desired
file of your own.

## Built With

* [Anaconda] (The navigator I downloaded for Python.)
* [Spyder] (The coding environment I used while creating the code Python.)

## Contributing

No contributions are being accepted; this is an individual project I did for
fun to test my knowledge of Python and Linear Algebra.
