# Linear Algebra Matrix Math

This project includes a class that allows for the creation of matricies and
contains some methods pertinant to typical matrix mathematics, including some
basic linear algebra methods. It also includes a text-based interface for using
the class's methods.

## Getting Started

To use the code, download the python files into the same directory, and run
the matrixInterface file. Or, just import the Matrix.py file to any desired
file of your own.

#### Prerequisites

The sympy library must be downloaded into your environment for some methods
of the Matrix class to function. Many enviroments (such as Anaconda) come with
sympy, thus in those situations extra instalation is unnecessary. In the event
that your Python environment does not already have it, the library can be
downloaded from github at [sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy) by following
instructions found in their README file.

## Built With

* [Anaconda] (The navigator I downloaded for Python.)
* [Spyder] (The coding environment I used while creating the code Python.)

## Contributing

No contributions are being accepted; this is an individual project I did for
fun to test my knowledge of Python and Linear Algebra.

* I refreshed my knowledge on how to compute an inverse using the determinant at [mathisfun.com](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/matrix-inverse-minors-cofactors-adjugate.html)
* Utilized the function 'solve' from the sympy library, github code found at [sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy)
* This project was inspired by Professor Jerod Weinman.
